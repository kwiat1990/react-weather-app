# React Weather App

With this mini poject I want to showcase my frontend skillset and challange myself while using React for the very first time. 

As matter of preference I like to work with real data, therefore the frontend uses free API from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). 

The source code on Github can be seen [here](https://github.com/kwiat1990/react-weather-app).

## Tech stack 

- [React (with hooks)](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind (v3)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
